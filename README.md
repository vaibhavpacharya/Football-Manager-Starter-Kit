## Face Packs

The original game does come with faces but not for all of them understandably as they want game to be available for all types of machines that have low disk spaces. I have seen many popular teams like manchester united and barcelona dont have any player faces. This does take away some experience and using facepacks can make any persons experience much more immersive. There are many great online facepacks available on internet, however, I find one that really suits my needs.

Adding face packs is usually a disk heavy (i am talking about space. No in game speed impact i believe) operation. 

> Founded in 2010, DF11 Faces was the first to specialize in large player images for optional use in Football Manager.
Nowadays, with 13 years of experience our fanmade faces are a household name in the FM community and are even used within the football industry to bring databases, websites and scouting reports to life.
The original DF11 Faces are sized 260 x 310 pixels by default in excellent quality, to bring you the most realistic Football Manager experience on your PC.

A real must have for all versions of Football Manager

## Badges & Logos - Clubs, Nations and Competetions

The license management system is very complicated to say the least. Per my limited understanding, license holders can give rights individually or at competition levels which helps spread out he money and help all the clubs irrespective if its big or small. Rights packages may say something like "you can use only My Team Name, but not the Kit, and only for Managergames on PC, not user-controlled simulations, only in your local market, etc. If you want to use the Kit, you need to pay extra and you get it only for "digital entertainment products" or something like that", because the Teams want to sell the rights to their Kits to other clients in the real world exclusively or additionally.  Again, this does take away some experience and using using badges and logos packages within the game can make any persons experience much more immersive. There are many great online badges and logs available on internet, however, I have mentioned some of my favourites below:

Football Manager Logos are one of the most popular types of FM Graphics available. Club Logos, Competition Logos, Nation Logos and Team Logos are all available online.

- [sortitoutsi club badges] - "Logo Packs include thousands of realistic Logos for Football Manager"
- [tcm club badges] - "Adopt the brilliant TCM23 Logo megapack for Football Manager 2023 by TCMLogos.com."

## Kits

The ingame kits are listed and displayed in the club info screen in football manager. Again, same as before, The license management system is very complicated to say the least. Per my limited understanding, license holders can give rights individually or at competition levels which helps spread out he money and help all the clubs irrespective if its big or small. Rights packages may say something like "you can use only My Team Name, but not the Kit, and only for Managergames on PC, not user-controlled simulations, only in your local market, etc. If you want to use the Kit, you need to pay extra and you get it only for "digital entertainment products" or something like that", because the Teams want to sell the rights to their Kits to other clients in the real world exclusively or additionally.  Again, this does take away some experience and using kits packages within the game can make any persons experience much more immersive. There are many great online kits available on internet, however, I have mentioned some of my favourites below:

## Name Fixes - Clubs and Competitions

There are certaom national teams like germany, france etc, all brazilian clubs (3 letter abbreviations), non playing staff like Ajax etc, club nicknames etc where the names are fake or mispronounced . Again, same as before, The license management system is very complicated to say the least. Per my limited understanding, license holders can give rights individually or at competition levels which helps spread out he money and help all the clubs irrespective if its big or small. Rights packages may say something like "you can use only My Team Name, but not the Kit, and only for Managergames on PC, not user-controlled simulations, only in your local market, etc. If you want to use the Kit, you need to pay extra and you get it only for "digital entertainment products" or something like that", because the Teams want to sell the rights to their Kits to other clients in the real world exclusively or additionally.  Again, this does take away some experience and using name fixes within the game can make any persons experience much more immersive. There are many  online fixes available on internet, however, I have mentioned some of my favourites below:

- [sortitoutsi real name fix] - "The sortitoutsi real names fix changes the instances of fake names in Football Manager 2023 to the proper, real life names for awards, cities, stadiums and competitions."
- [fmscout real name fix] - "Welcome to Real Names License Fix for Football Manager 2023 by FM Scout. This is an extremely comprehensive name fix that first appeared here since 2013."


## Skins

Football manager can sometimes become old fashined and boring (UI / looks wise) because of there default skin. Fortunately, many developers work hard in making our in-game experience more modern by customizing the interface, panels, layouts, themes, color schemes and bundling them in a nice skin and releasing to the audience. This is not mandatory in any way but it can improve the way you interact with the game and get the maximum out of it for example listing player stats, player comparison etc. Lot of websites and blogs keep track of new skin uploads and list them on their website.  Here are some of my favouite websites:

- [fmscout skins] - "Change the looks of your Football Manager 2023 interface by choosing custom made FM skins and panel mods. Find quality FM skins only."
- [sortitoutsi skins] - "We have all the best FM Skins for download and our skins viewer will help you compare each skin using a variety of screenshots."
- [fminside skins] - "Lesser know skins for the FM game."
- [footballmanagerblog skins] - "Here you can find the best Football Manager skins. Download HQ FM skins and ones for lower screen resolutions, like 1366x768. Learn how to install FM skins."

## Trophies

Football manager does not diaply original trophies for national and continental competitions. Again, same as before, The license management system is very complicated to say the least. Per my limited understanding, license holders can give rights individually or at competition levels which helps spread out he money and help all the clubs irrespective if its big or small. Rights packages may say something like "you can use only My Team Name, but not the Kit, and only for Managergames on PC, not user-controlled simulations, only in your local market, etc. If you want to use the Kit, you need to pay extra and you get it only for "digital entertainment products" or something like that", because the Teams want to sell the rights to their Kits to other clients in the real world exclusively or additionally.  Again, this does take away some experience and using trophy packs within the game can make any persons experience much more immersive. There are many online packs available on internet, however, the trophy pack from sortitoutsi is my favourite:

- [sortitoutsi trophy pack] - "This is the sortitoutsi trophy pack (also part of the metallic logo megapack)."
- [fmscout trophy pack] - "More than 1230 real trophies to add in Football Manager with this pack by DazS8.."

## Backgrounds and Stadiums

This is a bit of fancy addon to have. Some may not even prefer to download this as it may take away the "football manager" expecrience away and may think its too much. But I like it. Like i said earlier, sometimes FM can become and feel boring due its default skin/theme expecially if you are doing a journeyman save and or in a save for a long time. Having Stadium background will enhance your experience and the game more colourful. There are a few online packs available on internet, however, the trophy pack from sortitoutsi is my favourite:

- [sortitoutsi background and stadium pack] - "The Backgrounds Megapack was originally made up of aerial shots of stadiums taken from Google Maps and Google Earth, but is now also containing Competitions, Player and Fan Backgrounds, as well as beautiful City Images."
